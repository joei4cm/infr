//! Shared graph-executor skeleton: the residency contract + the op walk.
//!
//! Every backend runs the same *shape* around its per-op bodies — provision a working slot for each
//! [`TensorId`], walk `plan.graph.ops` in order eliding the fusion-skipped indices, then copy the
//! handles the caller reads back to their bound buffers. That structure was re-derived once per
//! backend (cpu `infr-cpu/src/lib.rs`, metal `Resident`/`run_graph`,
//! vulkan `execute_static`/`record_decode_replay`), and the pieces that MUST agree between them — which
//! [`TensorKind`]s are materialized, which are mutated in place, which are written back, and what
//! "the ops the executor actually dispatches" means — were three independent copies of the same
//! three predicates. This module hosts those ONCE.
//!
//! ## What is shared and what deliberately is not
//!
//! Shared here (pure host logic over the IR, no device types):
//!
//! * [`Provision`]/[`provisions`] — the pre-walk per-handle action (materialize zeroed scratch,
//!   load a bound `Input`, or leave alone).
//! * [`writes_back`]/[`write_back_targets`] — the post-walk write-back predicate.
//! * [`live_ops`] — THE definition of the executor's walk: graph order, fusion-skipped indices
//!   elided. Anything that must stay in lockstep with the walk iterates
//!   the same function rather than re-spelling the filter.
//! * [`OpDispatch`]/[`run_ops`] — the walk as a driver, for the backends whose per-op body is
//!   already one function. Generic (`impl OpDispatch`), so the per-op call stays static dispatch.
//!
//! NOT shared, on purpose:
//!
//! * **The residency CONTAINER.** The three disagree on it for real reasons, not drift: cpu keeps a
//!   host-only `Vec<Vec<f32>>`; metal keeps both PLUS a `loc: Vec<Loc>` host/device tracker
//!   (43 sites); vulkan has no per-op residency at all (its `Internal` scratch is
//!   allocated up front by `alloc_scratch` and the walk only records into a command buffer). A
//!   common container would have to be either the LCD (dropping metal's `loc`) or the union (an
//!   unused `loc` on cpu) — and either way every one of the ~240 `vals`/`dev`/`loc` accesses in
//!   the per-op bodies would be rewritten. Behavior-neutral in principle, a rewrite in fact.
//! * **The per-op bodies / a per-op trait method.** The `match Op::` arm sets are parallel, but the
//!   arms need wildly different ambient state (vulkan's `lower_op` threads 15 extra parameters —
//!   recorder, scratch, pool, dyn-attn contexts, mmv memo, streamed-weight substitution). A 27-method trait would move ~10k lines for no line
//!   saved and would have to carry every backend's ambient state in its `Self`.
//! * **Vulkan's walk.** It is a RECORDER, not an interpreter: no host values, no residency
//!   transitions, and its loop carries five device concerns between ops (submit splitter, shutdown
//!   poll, paged-MoE hand-off, dense-streaming stage, an E2B peephole that MUTATES the skip set
//!   mid-walk). It uses [`live_ops`] where the skip set is immutable and keeps its own loop.
