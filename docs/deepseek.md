# DeepSeek support plan (V1 → V2/V3 → V3.2 → V4)

Status: **Stage 3 done.** A `deepseek32` (V3.2) model loads, builds a graph with
the lightning indexer wired in, and generates on CPU and Vulkan — see § Stage 3
for what that is verified against and what cannot be verified without a real
671B file.

Stage 2: CPU path works end-to-end on V2-Lite; Vulkan and Metal MLA kernels are
implemented, wired, and executed on their real devices (Vulkan on the GPU box,
Metal via the macOS CI job's parity suite); Vulkan MoE is implemented;
exp_probs_b loads from V3 GGUFs; the GPU seam test passes (cosine 0.9955
CPU-vs-Vulkan, matching greedy output vs llama.cpp c629da5); the YaRN ramp is
verified numerically against llama.cpp at short AND long context (see the
checklist).

Stage 1 (`deepseek`) was skipped — V2-Lite is the development model.

The reference implementation is llama.cpp, checked out locally at
`~/Projects/mxaddict/llama.cpp`, now at `b10356-2-g030ebb5`
(`030ebb558a5820b444a8f836ed5cdd46c9b4bd7a`). Every claim about DeepSeek's maths
in this document was read out of that tree, and every claim about what `infr`
already has was read out of this one. Where something was **not** verified it
says so — those lines are the ones to check first, not to trust.

The document was originally written against `b10218-1-gc629da5`
(`c629da565c80b0b17fac6262acdca4d772e745d8`). The 2026-08-11 pull advanced the
checkout by 139 commits and touched all four files this document draws from, so
each maths claim was re-checked at the new pin: the trunk YaRN pre-scale, the
lightning indexer, the V4 hyper-connection helpers and `build_moe_ffn`'s router
bias are all **unchanged**. What did move — a second YaRN copy in the new
`graph_mtp`, the SwiGLU-clamp arm widening to `LLM_ARCH_DFLASH`, and the V3.2
layer-count switch — is itemised in `backlog.md` § B-DSHW-PULL.

Re-verified against both trees on 2026-08-05. That pass corrected the stage-1
rope-type mapping (it prescribed a permute that would have corrupted output),
renamed the router fields to where they actually live, and closed the Metal
shared-expert and LayerNorm questions. Everything else below survived the check
unchanged, including the llama.cpp line counts and every GGUF key name.

The generic procedure for adding any architecture — dump, diff, register, load,
graph, verify — is
[plan.md § Adding a model architecture](plan.md#adding-a-model-architecture-the-recipe).
This document is only what is DeepSeek-specific on top of it.

Disk paging is what stages 3–4 run on at all; it landed (`69b6de0`, `588653b`).
[backlog.md](backlog.md) B36 holds the paging optimizations that were measured
but **not** built, including the one §0.3 below depends on.

## Why this order

llama.cpp keeps **five** DeepSeek architectures, not one. They are separate
model classes with separate builders (`llama-model.cpp`, the
`LLM_ARCH_DEEPSEEK*` arms of `llama_model::create`):

| GGUF `general.architecture` | models                         | llama.cpp builder             |       size |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------: |
| `deepseek`                  | DeepSeek-LLM 7B/67B, MoE-16B   | `src/models/deepseek.cpp`     |  194 lines |
| `deepseek2`                 | V2, V2-Lite, V3, V3-0324, V3.1 | `src/models/deepseek2.cpp`    |  438 lines |
| `deepseek2-ocr`             | DeepSeek-OCR                   | `src/models/deepseek2ocr.cpp` |          — |
| `deepseek32`                | V3.2                           | `src/models/deepseek32.cpp`   |  506 lines |
| `deepseek4`                 | V4-Flash, V4-Pro               | `src/models/deepseek4.cpp`    | 1203 lines |

The staging follows from one hard constraint: **only the first two stages have a
model small enough to develop against.**

| stage | arch         | development model                                | fits a 24 GB card?   |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 1     | `deepseek`   | `deepseek-llm-7b-chat`, `deepseek-moe-16b-chat`  | yes (~4 / ~10 GB Q4) |
| 2     | `deepseek2`  | `DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat` (16B total, 2.4B active) | yes (~10 GB Q4)      |
| 3     | `deepseek32` | **none — V3.2 is 671B**                          | no                   |
| 4     | `deepseek4`  | **none — V4-Flash smallest quant is 82.5 GB**    | no                   |

GGUFs for the stage-1/2 models exist (TheBloke, mradermacher, legraphista).
Stages 3 and 4 can only ever be exercised through the disk pager at 80+ GB, at a
few tokens/sec, with no CPU oracle that finishes in reasonable time. **So stages
1–2 must leave behind MLA and MoE-routing pieces that are independently tested,
because from stage 3 on there is no cheap way to find a bug.**

`deepseek2-ocr` is out of scope; it is a vision model that reuses the arch id.

## What `infr` already has

Verified against this tree. There is **no plugin system** — an architecture is a
set of fields on one `Config`, branched on inside one graph builder and one
weight-load loop.

Already present and directly reusable:

Note on naming: there is no `MoeConfig` type. Everything the router is
configured by lives as **fields on the `Op::MoeFfn` variant** in
`infr-core/src/graph.rs` (`gating`, `norm_w`, `scale`, `n_expert`, `n_used`,
`n_ff_exp`, `down_scale`, `fused_gate_up`, `weight_before`, `ep_band`) — grep
for the variant, not for a struct.

- **Sigmoid MoE gating** — `MoeGating::Sigmoid` (`infr-core/src/graph.rs`),
  CPU + Vulkan. This is V3's `scoring_func`.
- **Gate-weight normalisation on/off** (`Op::MoeFfn`'s `norm_w`) — DeepSeek's
  `norm_topk_prob`.
- **Routed scaling factor** (`Op::MoeFfn`'s `scale`), read from
  `{arch}.expert_weights_scale` — the same GGUF key DeepSeek uses.
- **Shared experts, plain-summed** — `FfnW::Moe { shexp }` with tensor names
  `ffn_{gate,up,down}_shexp`. DeepSeek's shared expert is plain-summed, so the
  llama4 path fits.
- **Expert count headroom** — the Vulkan `moe_topk.comp` supports up to 1024
  experts; V3/V4's 256 fit.
- **Expert paging** — `infr-core/src/pager.rs` + `hostpager.rs` +
  `infr-vulkan/src/pager.rs`, keyed `(layer, role, expert_id)`.
- **Partial RoPE** — `Op::Rope` rotates the first `rope_dim` of each head and
  passes the rest through, which is exactly DeepSeek's decoupled rope shape.
- **Per-layer heterogeneity** — `Config::layer_head_dim`, `layer_n_kv`,
  `layer_rope_theta`, `is_swa_layer`, `is_moe_layer` and friends already exist.
- **Low-rank projections** need no new op: `Linear → RmsNorm → Linear` covers
  `wq_a → q_a_norm → wq_b`.
- **All the weight quants** V4 ships — every IQ1/IQ2/IQ3/IQ4 and k-quant has a
  native Vulkan dense kernel.

Missing, and these are the real cost:

- **MLA attention.** `Op::Attention` carries a single `head_dim` shared by Q, K
  and V, and both the CPU and Vulkan implementations index caches as
  `rows × n_kv × head_dim`. MLA's absorbed form (K 576 wide, V 512 wide,
  `n_kv = 1`) is **not expressible**. Confirmed by grep: `mla`, `latent`,
  `kv_a`, `kv_b`, `lora_rank` appear nowhere under `crates/`.
- **Group-limited routing** (`n_group` / `topk_group`) — no field anywhere; the
  top-k shader is a flat global top-k.
- **Router bias correction** (`e_score_correction_bias` / `exp_probs_b`) — not
  loaded. This changes _which_ experts are selected, so ignoring it is wrong
  output, not a quality nudge. It also breaks an invariant the Vulkan
  `moe_topk.comp` documents: that both gating functions are monotone in the
  logit, so top-k-by-logit picks the same set. With a selection bias the pick
  must use the biased score and the weight must come from the unbiased one.
- **YaRN.** Zero occurrences of `yarn`, `rope_scaling`, `beta_fast`,
  `ext_factor` under `crates/`. (The hits in `ref/` are vendored llama.cpp
  sources, read-only, not compiled.)
- **Sparse attention / an indexer** — nothing analogous. `AttnMask` has only
  causal, sliding-window and the diffusion canvas.
- **`is_moe_layer` is periodic** (`(il+1) % step == 0`), but DeepSeek wants
  "first N dense, rest MoE" — a threshold. New branch.
- **Metal has no `MoeSharedExpertAdd` kernel** (`infr-metal/src/exec.rs` returns
  `Unsupported`), so any path using the _gated_ shared expert is Vulkan+CPU
  only. **Checked: this does not bite DeepSeek.** That op is only emitted for a
  per-token-sigmoid-gated shared expert (qwen35moe); an ungated one is summed in
  plain with `Op::Add`, which is the llama4 path and exists on all three
  backends — see `FfnW::Moe`'s `shexp` doc in `seam/weights.rs` and
  `Config::shexp_gated`.
- **Metal cannot run a DeepSeek MoE layer at all**, for a different reason than
  the one above. Its `Op::MoeFfn` arm implements softmax gating + top-k renorm +
  output-weighting and asserts on anything else, so V2-Lite
  (`norm_topk_prob = false`) already fails that assert, and V3 (sigmoid) fails
  it too. It also reads neither `exp_probs_b` nor the group-routing fields —
  softmax + renorm + `expert_group_count > 1` is a legal `deepseek2` config that
  used to pass the assert and then route with neither applied, silently; that
  combination now asserts as well. DeepSeek is CPU + Vulkan for the MoE layers
  until a Metal router gains those inputs. MLA attention itself IS implemented
  on Metal.

### Places a new arch string must be registered

1. `infr-llama/src/arch.rs` — the `pub const`, plus `arch::TRANSFORMER` and
   `arch::ALL`. Neither list gates anything: `TRANSFORMER` is read once to
   render the rejection message (`config.rs`), and `ALL` currently has **no
   consumer at all**. They are documentation that happens to compile — adding to
   them does not make the arch load.
2. `infr-llama/src/config.rs`, the `match arch.as_str()` inside
   `Config::from_gguf` — **this is the load gate**; an unknown arch fails here
   and nowhere else.
3. `infr-cli/src/main.rs`, `arch_sampling` — recommended sampling defaults
   (optional; falls back to `(0.6, 20, 0.95)`).
4. `infr-llama/src/tokenizer.rs`, the `match pre` — see below, this one is
   required for DeepSeek.

The two commits worth reading as templates are `5b44ef9` (BitNet — the floor for
a config-only arch, 5 files) and `e24399d` (llama4 Scout — the shape of an arch
that needs new op semantics, 15 files including `graph.rs` and all backends).

## Stage 0 — prerequisites, before any architecture

These are independent of which DeepSeek you start with, and two of them are
things you would otherwise discover as silent wrongness.

### 0.1 Dump a real GGUF first

`crates/infr-gguf/examples/dump.rs` exists for this. Run it on a real DeepSeek
GGUF before planning around anything below. Specifically confirm: the ggml type
ids used (anything outside `ggml_type_to_dtype` in `infr-gguf/src/lib.rs` fails
at `Gguf::open`), the exact metadata keys, and the head layouts.

### 0.2 Tokenizer — a real gap, not a formality

llama.cpp maps three DeepSeek pre-tokenizers (`src/llama-vocab.cpp`):

| `tokenizer.ggml.pre` | patterns | `clean_spaces` |
| -------------------- | -------: | -------------- |
| `deepseek-llm`       |        6 | false          |
| `deepseek-coder`     |        5 | false          |
| `deepseek-v3`        |        3 | false          |

V3 uses `deepseek-v3`; V4 reuses it (there is no `deepseek-v4` pre-type).

llama.cpp applies these as an **ordered list of successive splits**. `infr`
implements this in `build_multi_split_seq` (`infr-llama/src/tokenizer.rs`): N
`Split` pre-tokenizers in `Isolated` mode followed by `ByteLevel`, with the
regex lists in `infr-llama/src/util.rs` (`DEEPSEEK_LLM_PRE_RES`,
`DEEPSEEK_CODER_PRE_RES`, `DEEPSEEK_V3_PRE_RES`).

**Collapsing the list into one alternation is not equivalent** — and the
successive form is no longer an assumption either. It was checked against
`llama-tokenize` token ids; see open question 3, which is now resolved.

All fourteen regexes were diffed codepoint by codepoint against
`llama-vocab.cpp` (2026-08-09) and now match it exactly. Two did not, and the
symptom of each is instructive: a wrong character inside a class compiles, runs,
raises nothing, and merely moves a chunk boundary.

- `DEEPSEEK_LLM_PRE_RES[2]` opened its quote range with `'` (U+0027) where the
  reference has `‘` (U+2018), so the class ran U+0027–U+201F instead of the
  eight quote characters — most of the BMP, including the ASCII digits, Hebrew,
  Arabic and Devanagari.
- `DEEPSEEK_LLM_PRE_RES[1]` had `ℹ-ℿ` where the reference has `ℹℼ-ℿ`, adding
  U+213A and U+213B to the letter class.

`clean_spaces = false`, which llama.cpp sets for all three DeepSeek pre-types,
**needs no equivalent here**. It is read in exactly one place —
`llama_vocab::impl::detokenize` in `llama-vocab.cpp` — where it drops the space
before `?!.,`, strips a lone apostrophe between spaces, and closes up
`'s`/`'m`/`'re`/`'ve`. It is a detokenizer post-process (HF's
`clean_up_tokenization_spaces`) and never runs during encoding, so it cannot
affect token ids. llama.cpp defaults the flag to `false`, turns it ON for every
BPE vocab, and the DeepSeek arms turn it back off. `infr` detokenizes through
`tokenizers::Tokenizer::decode`, and that crate contains no such pass at all —
so `infr` is unconditionally in the `clean_spaces = false` state DeepSeek wants.
(It is therefore also unconditionally in that state for BPE pre-types where
llama.cpp leaves the flag ON. That is a display-only divergence, not an id one,
and it is out of scope here.)

The lists are guarded by
`deepseek_pre_split_boundaries_match_the_reference_lists` in `tokenizer.rs`,
which pins the chunk boundaries all three produce and needs no model file.

Getting this wrong degrades output with **no error at all**, which is why it is
stage 0.

### 0.3 Pager LRU

`docs/backlog.md` already records it: `Pager`'s `mark_mru`/`evict`/`take_slot`
are `O(n_slots)` per touch. At V4-Flash scale (256 experts × 43 layers ≈ 11k
blocks per role) that stops being acceptable. Not needed for stages 1–2; needed
before stage 4 is usable.

## Stage 1 — `deepseek` (V1)

**Smallest possible first step, and it buys a real model.** No MLA, no YaRN, no
indexer. Plain MHA plus DeepSeek-style MoE.

### Hyperparameters (`{arch}.` prefixed)

| key                                | maps to                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `attention.layer_norm_rms_epsilon` | RMS eps                    |
| `leading_dense_block_count`        | `n_layer_dense_lead`       |
| `expert_feed_forward_length`       | `n_ff_exp`                 |
| `expert_shared_count`              | `n_expert_shared`          |
| `expert_weights_scale`             | routed scaling (default 0) |

V1 has **no** `expert_gating_func` and **no** `expert_weights_norm` — it
hardcodes softmax scoring and no normalisation.

### Attention

Vanilla MHA. `n_embd_head_v == n_embd_head_k == n_rot` (llama.cpp asserts it).
Full-dim rope on Q and K, rope type **NORM** (interleaved consecutive pairs).
`kq_scale = 1/sqrt(n_embd_head)`.

**Do NOT set `Config::permute_qk_neox`.** All five DeepSeek arches return
`LLAMA_ROPE_TYPE_NORM` from `llama_model_rope_type` (`src/llama-model.cpp`) —
the same arm as `LLM_ARCH_LLAMA`, not the NEOX arm that `LLM_ARCH_QWEN2` sits
in. The permute exists to make infr's interleaved (NORM) `Op::Rope` reproduce
**NEOX** for an arch whose GGUF stayed in HF rotate-half order (qwen2, bitnet —
see the field's own doc in `config.rs`). DeepSeek is already NORM with
converter-permuted rows, exactly like llama, so permuting would rotate the wrong
pairs and produce fluent nonsense. This applies to stage 2's `q_pe`/`k_pe` as
well; the one NEOX rope in the family is the V3.2 indexer (stage 3), which is
hardcoded NEOX against a NORM main rope.

Nothing new is required in the IR.

### MoE

`softmax(logits)` → top-k → gather → **no** normalisation → `× scale` → SwiGLU
experts → add shared expert. All of this exists.

### New work

- Arch registration (§ above).
- `is_moe_layer` needs a **first-N-dense threshold** mode alongside the existing
  periodic one.
- Shared-expert width: llama.cpp allocates `ffn_*_shexp` as
  `{n_embd, n_ff_exp * n_expert_shared}` — one fused branch of `n_expert_shared`
  experts' width. `infr` models exactly one branch of width `shexp_ff`, so
  setting `shexp_ff = n_ff_exp * n_expert_shared` should line up. **Verify
  against a real GGUF** — V2-Lite has `n_shared_experts = 2` and is the first
  case where this matters.

### Done when

- `cpu_deepseek_config` — opens the GGUF, asserts the arch string, asserts every
  gate boolean including that other arches' gates are false. (Pattern:
  `cpu_bitnet_config` in `infr-llama/tests/cpu_backend.rs`.)
- `cpu_deepseek_prefill_paris` — top-1 token after "The capital of France is".
  (Pattern: `cpu_bitnet_prefill_paris`.)
- `gpu_seam_matches_cpu_deepseek` — token-identical CPU vs Vulkan, `#[ignore]`d
  behind a GPU. Use the **strict** form for the 7B dense model and the **loose**
  form (top-5 overlap + `cosine > 0.5`) for MoE-16B, for the same reason
  `gpu_seam_matches_cpu_qwen35moe` does: routing near-ties legitimately flip.

**No CI golden.** The `cpu-goldens` job downloads two ~1B GGUFs; the smallest
DeepSeek is 7B. Commit `273f8d4` already removed qwen35 from that job because an
exact-token golden did not reproduce across machines.

## Stage 2 — `deepseek2` (V2, V2-Lite, V3, V3.1)

The big one, and the one with a 16 GB development model. Everything here is
reused by stage 3 almost verbatim.

### Hyperparameters

Adds to stage 1: `attention.q_lora_rank`, `attention.kv_lora_rank`,
`attention.key_length_mla`, `attention.value_length_mla`, `expert_weights_norm`,
`expert_gating_func` (1 softmax / 2 sigmoid / 3 softmax-on-weights / 4
sqrt-softplus), `rope.scaling.yarn_log_multiplier`, `expert_group_count`,
`expert_group_used_count`.

Derived: `key_length = kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim` (576 for V3),
`value_length = kv_lora_rank` (512), `head_count_kv = 1`,
`rope.dimension_count = qk_rope_head_dim` (64). **Read these from a GGUF rather
than trusting the numbers here** — they were derived from the conversion
script's formulas, not read out of a file.

Two loader details worth copying exactly:

- **`rope_yarn_log_mul /= 0.1`** on load. The convert script writes
  `0.1 * mscale_all_dim`; the loader divides it back out. Double-applying or
  double-cancelling this is a silent long-context quality bug.
- **"lite" detection.** llama.cpp has a heuristic on layer count and vocab size,
  but the graph actually decides on **tensor presence** (`wq` present ⇒ lite,
  else `wq_a`/`wq_b`). Port the tensor-presence test and drop the heuristic.

### Tensors

Per layer, beyond the stage-1 set:

| tensor            | GGUF name                      | shape                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `wq_a`            | `blk.%d.attn_q_a.weight`       | `{n_embd, q_lora_rank}`                     |
| `attn_q_a_norm`   | `blk.%d.attn_q_a_norm.weight`  | `{q_lora_rank}`                             |
| `wq_b`            | `blk.%d.attn_q_b.weight`       | `{q_lora_rank, n_head * head_k_mla}`        |
| `wq` (lite)       | `blk.%d.attn_q.weight`         | `{n_embd, n_head * head_k_mla}`             |
| `wkv_a_mqa`       | `blk.%d.attn_kv_a_mqa.weight`  | `{n_embd, kv_lora_rank + qk_rope}`          |
| `attn_kv_a_norm`  | `blk.%d.attn_kv_a_norm.weight` | `{kv_lora_rank}`                            |
| `wk_b`            | `blk.%d.attn_k_b.weight`       | `{qk_nope, kv_lora_rank, n_head}`           |
| `wv_b`            | `blk.%d.attn_v_b.weight`       | `{kv_lora_rank, v_head_dim, n_head}`        |
| `wo`              | `blk.%d.attn_output.weight`    | `{n_head * v_head_dim, n_embd}`             |
| `ffn_exp_probs_b` | `blk.%d.exp_probs_b.bias`      | `{n_expert}` — optional, V3's noaux_tc bias |

**`wk_b` is transposed relative to the HF weight and `wv_b` is not.** The
conversion script splits `kv_b` into `k_b`/`v_b` and calls `.transpose(1, 2)` on
`k_b` only. This is the classic MLA porting bug — getting it backwards produces
plausible-looking garbage.

### The attention, step by step

Head layout is **`[nope | rope]`, nope first**, on Q. The KV projection is
`[latent(512) | rope(64)]`.

```
q      = wq_b · RMSNorm_{q_a_norm}(wq_a · x)      # or wq · x when lite
q_nope = q[0 .. qk_nope]                          # per head
q_pe   = q[qk_nope .. qk_nope+qk_rope]

kv_cmpr_pe = wkv_a_mqa · x                        # {512+64, n_tokens}
kv_cmpr    = kv_cmpr_pe[0 .. 512]                 # the latent
k_pe       = kv_cmpr_pe[512 .. 576]               # ONE rope head, shared by all query heads

q_pe = rope(q_pe, n_rot=64, NORM)
k_pe = rope(k_pe, n_rot=64, NORM)
kv_cmpr = RMSNorm_{kv_a_norm}(kv_cmpr)            # AFTER the split, BEFORE absorption
```

`attn_kv_a_norm` applies **only** to the 512-wide latent, not to `k_pe`.
`attn_q_a_norm` sits **only** between `wq_a` and `wq_b`.

Then the absorbed form:

```
q_nope_absorbed = wk_b[h]ᵀ · q_nope[h]            # {128} -> {512}, per head
Q = concat(q_nope_absorbed, q_pe)                 # {576, n_head}
K = concat(kv_cmpr, k_pe)                         # {576, 1}
V = kv_cmpr                                       # {512, 1}  -- an ALIASED PREFIX VIEW of K
out = wv_b · attn(Q, K, V)                        # wv_b applied to the OUTPUT, {512}->{128} per head
```

Three things that will each silently corrupt output:

1. **Only one 576-wide row is cached per token per layer.** There is no separate
   V cache; V is the first 512 columns of K.
2. **`wv_b` is applied after the KQV product**, not to the cache.
3. **`kq_scale` divides by `head_k_mla` (192), not by 576** and not by the
   concatenated Q width.

There is also an "unabsorbed" legacy path for older GGUFs carrying `wkv_b`
instead of `wk_b`/`wv_b`: it up-projects to full MHA, broadcasts `k_pe` across
all heads, and uses ordinary K/V caches. **Skip it** unless a target GGUF needs
it — it is a much larger cache for identical output.

### YaRN

Two stages that must not double-apply:

```
attn_factor_org = attn_factor * (1 + 0.1·ln(1/freq_scale))
mscale          = attn_factor_org * (1 + 0.1·rope_yarn_log_mul·ln(1/freq_scale))
kq_scale        = mscale² / sqrt(head_k_mla)
```

The mscale² is folded into the **softmax scale**, not applied to Q, because
ggml's rope already applies `attn_factor` to the rotated slice and the first
line undoes it.

For `infr`, the frequency ramp itself should fold into the existing
`freq_factors` mechanism (`Op::Rope`'s optional per-pair divisor, already used
by gemma4's proportional rope): precompute the ramp on the host at load and bind
it like `rope_freqs.weight`. **This is an inference from the maths, not
something either codebase states — validate numerically against llama.cpp before
relying on it.**

### MoE

Order matters:

1. `logits = gate_inp · x`
2. score: softmax / sigmoid / sqrt-softplus per `expert_gating_func`
3. **`selection_probs = probs + exp_probs_b`** — bias affects _selection only_;
   the returned weights are read from the **unbiased** `probs`
4. group-limited routing when `n_expert_groups > 1`: per group take the **top
   2** scores and sum them for a group score, take the top `n_group_used`
   groups, mask the rest to `-inf`. The top-2-within-group is **hardcoded** in
   llama.cpp and matches V3, but is not the general `topk_group` formulation.
5. top-k over `selection_probs`
6. gather weights from `probs`
7. if `norm_w`: divide by `clamp(sum, 6.103515625e-5, inf)` — the clamp is the
   smallest normal f16
8. if `scale != 0 && != 1`: multiply
9. SwiGLU experts, weighted sum
10. add the shared expert; first `n_layer_dense_lead` layers instead run a plain
    dense SwiGLU with `n_ff` (not `n_ff_exp`) and no shared expert

### New work

- **MLA in the IR.** `Op::Attention` needs asymmetric K/V dims (or a new
  `Op::Mla`). This touches KV-cache sizing (`seam/mod.rs`, `seam/weights.rs`,
  `runner.rs` all compute `layer_n_kv * layer_head_dim`) and every attention
  kernel on CPU, Vulkan and Metal. **This is the single biggest item in the
  whole plan and it is worth prototyping on CPU alone first.**
- `MoeFfn` gains an `exp_probs_b` input and group-routing fields; the Vulkan
  `moe_topk.comp` must select on the biased score and weight from the unbiased.
- YaRN ramp precomputation at load.
- A new `MixerW::Mla(MlaW { .. })` variant plus a third branch in each of the
  three lockstep loops in `runner.rs` (`wload`, `wpush`, emit). The file's own
  comments say these MUST mirror; getting them out of step is silent corruption.

### Done when

- [x] Config + CPU-finite + CPU-top-token tests on V2-Lite
      (`cpu_deepseek2_config`, `cpu_deepseek2_prefill_finite`,
      `cpu_deepseek2_prefill_paris` — all added 2026-08-06, gated behind model
      file).
- [x] `gpu_seam_matches_cpu_deepseek2` — skeleton added 2026-08-06; passing on
      the GPU box 2026-08-07 (CPU-vs-Vulkan cosine 0.9955, matching top-5) after
      the YaRN ramp + wk_b/wv_b orientation fixes.
- [x] `cpu_deepseek2_golden` — hash-locked generation, blessed from the coherent
      post-fix output (2026-08-07).
- [x] **An op-level MLA parity test** in `infr-llama/tests/seam_op_parity.rs`
      against a hand-written CPU reference, following `deltanet_parity`. This is
      the one that matters: it is the only cheap check that survives into stages
      3–4.
- [x] **A numeric YaRN check against llama.cpp at a long context** — done
      2026-08-07 on the V2-Lite Q4_K GGUF vs llama.cpp `c629da5` (CPU
      reference):
  - 228-token prompt, infr CPU prefill vs llama.cpp last-row logits: cosine
    0.978, greedy token identical (185).
  - 4560-token prompt (positions past `n_ctx_orig`=4096, in the ramp region),
    infr Vulkan prefill vs llama.cpp: cosine 0.860, greedy token identical
    (549). The seam's ff divisors / mscale are context-independent (llama.cpp
    runs the full ramp at every context length), so the short-CPU and long-GPU
    runs exercise the same numbers; both greedy tokens match.
  - **Ignore those two cosine numbers; the greedy tokens are the result.** This
    entry used to say both sat "in the established deepseek2 infr-vs-llama.cpp
    range (~0.79–0.91)". That range means nothing. Measured 2026-08-11 by
    `cpu_prefill_matches_llama_debug_dump`, on the same V2-Lite GGUF and over
    llama.cpp's own token ids: a **correct** match — both engines picking token
    8913 (" Paris"), probability cosine 0.9969 — scores a logit cosine of only
    **0.774**, while two **unrelated** rows of Qwen3-0.6B score **0.851**. A
    whole-vocab logit cosine is dominated by the per-token bias every row of a
    model shares, so a correct row can score below an unrelated one and the
    metric cannot separate them. Score agreement on mutual top-5 containment and
    a cosine over softmax **probabilities** (0.9969 vs 0.0164 for that unrelated
    pair). The greedy-token identity above is real evidence and stands.
- [x] Metal MLA kernel — `mla_f16kv` in `attention.metal` + `exec.rs` dispatch
      (2026-08-06; ported from `mla.comp`, f16 KV cache), plus the YaRN
      `mla_f16kv_ff` twin. Executed for the first time by `mla_parity` /
      `mla_ff_parity` in the Metal parity suite on the macOS CI job (2026-08-07)
      — which also caught and fixed an ff/params buffer-index swap in the kernel
      declaration.
- [x] **The doubled MLA residual** — found 2026-08-12 with a per-op tap on the
      CPU interpreter compared against `llama-debug --verbose`'s per-tensor
      `sum =` lines. `MixerW::Mla` pushed its own `hidden += sub` and then fell
      through to the shared post-mixer residual add, so every layer computed
      `x + 2·Wo·attn`. At layer 0 of a ten-token prefill, llama.cpp's
      `ffn_inp-0` last row reads `[-0.0645, 0.0322, -0.1029, …]` and infr's
      residual read `[-0.0921, 0.0076, -0.2065, …]` =
      `[-0.0636, 0.0309, -0.1029, …]` plus the attention output a second time.
      Everything upstream of it matched llama.cpp to four printed decimals,
      `k_pe` rope included. Next-token probability cosine against llama.cpp at
      ten tokens: 0.3336 → 0.9998 (CPU), 0.3156 → 0.99998 (Vulkan). Guarded by
      `synthetic_deepseek2_attention_enters_the_residual_once`, which recomputes
      a one-token MLA layer by hand — the only kind of check that can see it, as
      a doubled residual is indistinguishable from a `Wo` scaled by 2 to any
      test that only varies weights. Two goldens moved with it and were
      re-blessed in the same change, both because the residual stream they were
      blessed off was wrong: `cpu_deepseek2_golden` (V2-Lite now generates
      `" Paris."`, llama.cpp's own greedy continuation of that prompt at pin
      030ebb5, token for token) and `GOLDEN_DS32_TOPK5` /
      `synthetic_deepseek32_indexer_selection_is_locked` (the indexer's queries
      and keys are both projections of the attn-normed residual, so on every
      layer but the first the blessed key set came off the doubled stream). The
      indexer's own mechanism tests —
      `synthetic_deepseek32_top_k_restricts_attention` and
      `synthetic_deepseek32_full_top_k_matches_no_indexer_at_all` — were green
      before and after, and are what still holds that arithmetic in place.
- [x] YaRN per-dimension frequency ramp in `Op::Rope` and MLA kernels — the
      `freq_factors` divisors (`ff[p] = 1/s(p)` from the corr_dims spectral
      ramp) + the constant `mla_scale = mscale²/√(qk_nope+qk_rope)` landed in
      `784704e` (2026-08-07); verified numerically above.

## Stage 3 — `deepseek32` (V3.2)

**Progress: complete — a `deepseek32` model loads, builds a graph and
generates.** The indexer is wired end to end on CPU and Vulkan (executed on an
RX 7900 XTX under the validation layer) and typechecks on Metal, whose first
real execution is the macOS CI job's parity suite. What landed, on top of the
already-tested `Op::LayerNorm` and `Op::LightningIndexer`:

- **`Op::Rope` gained `neox`.** The indexer's rope is NEOX where the MLA rope
  beside it is NORM; `Op::Rope` had only the interleaved NORM pairing (the NEOX
  one existed solely fused inside `Op::QkNormRope`). CPU branches on the field;
  Vulkan compiles two more `rope.comp` builds (`rope_neox`, `rope_ff_neox`) and
  REFUSES `neox` on the f16-out / record-once paths, which have no such build;
  Metal carries it as a `RopeParams` field.
- **`Op::Mla` gained `key_bias`**, an optional additive `[rows, kv_len]` score
  mask, and **`Op::TopkMask`** expands the indexer's indices into it. `None` for
  `deepseek2`, where every backend takes exactly the code it took before.
- **The indexer's second KV cache rides the V side**
  `MLA leaves empty — see `seam::kv_row_elems`, which now answers `(kv_lora_rank +
  qk_rope_dim,
  indexer_head_size)`for`deepseek32`. All six geometry sites (allocation, graph declaration, `fork`, `seed_from`, both VRAM estimates) therefore size and copy it without any of them growing a private branch — under-reserving it is exactly backlog B41. The allocation asserts the cache does not ring, because `Op::LightningIndexer`
  masks causally only.
- **The refusal is gone**, replaced by an assertion on `MlaW::indexer`: a
  `deepseek32` model whose indexer weights were not captured fails at the emit
  instead of degrading to the deepseek2 graph.

### The cache and mask decisions, with their costs

**Second cache on the V side.** One `indexer_head_size`-wide f16 row per token
per layer: on V3.2 that is 128 halves = 256 B/token/layer against MLA's 576
halves = 1152 B, so the KV footprint grows ~22%. It cannot ring (see above), so
it is sized at the full context like any non-SWA side.

**Mask, not gather.** `Op::Mla` takes the `[rows, kv_len]` f32 mask; the inner
loop pays one extra f32 load per key and the graph pays `rows × kv_len` floats
of scratch (16 MiB at a 512-row ubatch and an 8192 context — the same order as
the indexer's own score scratch, which was already there). The alternative,
membership-testing the index list inside the MLA kernel, needs no scratch but
scans `top_k` (≈2048 on V3.2) per (row, head, key) — three orders of magnitude
worse on the inner loop. The mask is also what llama.cpp materialises, so the
numerics are comparable term by term. **The FLOP saving is still not realised**;
a gather remains a pure optimisation on top.

### What is verified, and what cannot be

All verification is synthetic — `tests/synthetic_deepseek2.rs` builds a
`deepseek32` GGUF from the same description as the `deepseek2` one plus an
indexer, since V3.2 is 671B and no real file can be obtained.

- `synthetic_deepseek32_cpu_prefill_is_finite` — the whole model runs.
- `gpu_synthetic_deepseek32_matches_cpu` — CPU vs Vulkan: cosine
  `0.9999999999998446`, same top token, on the GPU box under the Khronos
  validation layer with zero VUID lines. Everything the indexer adds executes
  there: `layernorm.comp`, `rope.comp`'s `-DNEOX` build, the second `WriteKv`,
  `lightning_indexer.comp`, `topk_mask.comp`, `mla.comp`'s `-DKEY_BIAS` build.
- `synthetic_deepseek32_full_top_k_matches_no_indexer_at_all` — with
  `top_k >= kv_len` the mask is all-zero and the CPU logits are
  **bit-identical** (`max|Δ| = 0`) to the same model with no indexer at all.
  This is the property that makes the mask faithful, and it is also what proves
  the indexer perturbs nothing else. Its Vulkan twin can only assert ~1 ULP
  (`9.536743e-7`): the masked build's score is `red[0]*scale + kbias[j]`, which
  the compiler fuses into one FMA where the unmasked build rounds the product
  separately, so the two pipelines differ by a rounding even at `kbias == 0`.
- `synthetic_deepseek32_top_k_restricts_attention` — at `top_k = 5` of 8 keys
  the output moves by `max|Δ| = 2.52` against a logit rms of `1.11`. A version
  of this suite without that case would pass with the mask never reaching the
  kernel.
- `rope_neox_and_norm_parity`, `topk_mask_parity`,
  `mla_key_bias_removes_the_masked_keys` in `seam_op_parity.rs` — op-level, CPU
  vs from-definition references and CPU vs Vulkan. The `key_bias` case checks
  the equivalence that matters: masking a key is exactly the key not being in
  the cache.
- `synthetic_deepseek32_indexer_selection_is_locked` — a tolerance-based lock on
  the restricted run's logits. It is a REGRESSION lock blessed from this
  implementation, not an independent oracle; what it buys is that the indexer's
  NEOX pairing and its `[rope | nope]` head order cannot change silently.

Each of the three traps was applied as a perturbation, seen to fail, and
reverted (2026-08-10, CPU, `--test synthetic_deepseek2`; the lock's own scale is
logit rms `1.0331706e0`):

| perturbation                                     | what went red                    |            max\|Δ\| |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| indexer roped NORM instead of NEOX               | the selection lock               |       `8.557266e-2` |
| indexer head read as `[nope \| rope]`            | the selection lock               |       `1.0638273e0` |
| `Op::Mla::key_bias` passed `None` (mask dropped) | the lock AND `top_k_restricts_…` | `2.5244246e0` / `0` |

The third row is the important one: with the mask dropped, `top_k = 5` and
`top_k >= kv_len` become **indistinguishable** (`max|Δ| = 0`), which is exactly
the failure a suite without that case would have shipped.

**Not verified, and not verifiable here:** anything against llama.cpp's own
numbers. There is no V3.2 GGUF and no CPU oracle, so the indexer's absolute
scores, the top-k it picks on a real model, and the resulting text are all
unchecked. The synthetic harness proves the pieces agree with their own
specifications and with each other across backends; it cannot prove the
specification matches DeepSeek.

**Metal has not executed any of this.**
`cargo check -p infr-metal --target x86_64-apple-darwin` typechecks the new arms
and the four `mla_f16kv*` entry points; the macOS CI parity job is the first
thing that runs them. (And a `deepseek32` MoE layer cannot run on Metal at all
yet, for the router reasons in "What `infr` already has".)

**~80% of this is stage 2 copied verbatim.** llama.cpp's `deepseek32.cpp` is
deepseek2's absorbed MLA path plus the lightning indexer. Non-MLA is rejected
outright. No small model exists; budget for slow iteration.

Adds: `attention.indexer.head_count`, `attention.indexer.key_length`,
`attention.indexer.top_k`, and `f_norm_eps` hardcoded to `1e-6`.
`expert_gating_func` is **mandatory** here (no fallback), and `q_lora_rank` is
mandatory (no lite variant).

### The lightning indexer

Per layer, unconditionally. It computes a scalar relevance score per (query
token, key token) and keeps the top-k keys for the real attention.

```
w[h, t]     = (indexer_proj · x)[h, t] / sqrt(index_head_dim · index_n_heads)
score[t, j] = Σ_h  w[h, t] · ReLU( q[h, t] · k[j] )  + causal_mask[t, j]
top_k       = argsort_top_k(score, min(n_kv, index_topk))
```

Note: **one key head shared by all indexer query heads** (MQA), the **ReLU is
inside the head-weighted sum**, and the `1/sqrt(d·H)` normaliser is pre-folded
into `w` to avoid scaling a huge score tensor.

New tensors: `indexer.k_norm.{weight,bias}`, `indexer.proj.weight`,
`indexer.attn_k.weight`, `indexer.attn_q_b.weight`.

Traps, each of which produces silent wrongness:

- **The indexer's rope type is NEOX, hardcoded**, while the main MLA rope is
  NORM. Same width, same frequencies, different pairing. **Done**: `Op::Rope`
  carries a `neox` flag on all three backends (§ Stage 3 progress above).
  `Config::permute_qk_neox` is NOT the tool — it is model-wide and keyed on
  `attn_q`/`attn_k` tensor names, so it cannot say "this one projection ropes
  NEOX while the model's main rope is NORM" (see § Stage 1).
- **The indexer head layout is `[rope | nope]`** — the _opposite_ of the MLA
  head. Worse, llama.cpp writes the nope view's offset as `row_size(nope)`
  rather than `row_size(rope)`; these coincide only because both are 64 for
  V3.2. **Ported as the layout says**: rope occupies each head's first `n_rot`
  dims, which is what makes both indexer ropes a plain `Op::Rope` with no offset
  and no split (that op rotates `[0, rope_dim)` of each head and passes the tail
  through). This port therefore does not depend on the coincidence at all, and
  the synthetic fixture runs at `head_size = 24, n_rot = 16` — nope 8 ≠ rope 16,
  a geometry where the two readings genuinely differ. Note the consequence: on a
  hypothetical V3.2-shaped model with nope ≠ rope, llama.cpp's view arithmetic
  and this port would disagree, and llama.cpp would be the one reading a
  misaligned nope.
- `indexer_k_norm` is a real **LayerNorm with bias** (mean-centred), the only
  non-RMS norm anywhere in the family — `graph.rs` carried `RmsNorm` and
  `RmsNormAdd` and nothing mean-centred, so it needed a new op rather than a
  config flag. **Done**: `Op::LayerNorm` landed on CPU, Vulkan
  (`layernorm.comp`) and Metal (`layernorm_f32`), with `layernorm_parity` in
  `seam_op_parity.rs` checking it against a from-definition f64 reference. The
  arithmetic follows `ggml_compute_forward_norm_f32`: the BIASED variance
  estimator, `eps` INSIDE the sqrt, then `* weight` then `+ bias`. Nothing emits
  it yet — the indexer is its first caller.
- The indexer keeps a **second, independent KV cache**: one
  `index_head_dim`-wide row per token per layer, on top of the 576-wide MLA
  cache. **Done**: it rides the V side MLA leaves empty (`seam::kv_row_elems`),
  and it must never ring.
- A **Hadamard rotation** is applied to q and k. It is an orthogonal transform
  applied identically to both, so dot products are preserved: it exists for
  quantisation friendliness and **can be skipped entirely** in an unquantised
  port.

### How top-k feeds attention

llama.cpp does **not** gather or compact. It builds a `-inf` mask everywhere
except the selected indices, adds it to the ordinary causal mask, and runs dense
attention over the full `n_kv`. The FLOP saving is not realised — only the
numerics are faithful.

**This is the interesting decision for `infr`.** A port that wants the actual
speedup must gather, and the selected indices are per (query token, stream), not
per head. Doing the mask version first is the safe order: it is checkable
against llama.cpp token-for-token, and the gather can follow as a pure
optimisation.

**Done, as the mask.** `Op::LightningIndexer` emits indices, `Op::TopkMask`
expands them into an additive `[rows, kv_len]` f32 mask (0 on the selected keys,
`-inf` elsewhere), and `Op::Mla::key_bias` adds it to the score. Costs are in §
Stage 3's "cache and mask decisions". `-inf` is safe rather than a large finite
negative because at least one key is always selected — `top_k >= 1`, and the
indexer ranks every causally-eligible key above every ineligible one — so each
row's softmax max is finite and `exp(-inf - max)` is 0 exactly.

## Stage 4 — `deepseek4` (V4-Flash / V4-Pro)

**Progress: a V4 model whose `compress_ratios` are ALL ZERO generates, under
either routing.** The ratio-0 tier is emitted end to end and runs on CPU and
Vulkan; ratios 4 and 128 are refused by name. See "Slice A — ratio 0" below for
what that covers, "Slice A2 — hash routing" for the `ffn_gate_tid2eid` gather,
and `docs/backlog.md` § B-DSV4-WIRING for what slice B owes. Note that no layer
of the SHIPPED V4-Flash file is both ratio-0 and bias-routed — see
`docs/backlog.md` § B-DSV4-REAL.

The 2026-08-10 read slice that preceded it was a read, not a port:
`llama-kv-cache-dsv4.cpp` had never been read in full, which made this section's
account of the compressed caches the least trustworthy part of the document. It
has been, and "The compressed-KV state machine" below is rewritten off it — the
real inventory, the per-ubatch index plan, four boundary conditions, and two
corrections to what this document previously claimed about V4's indexer (its
rope type and its head order were both stated backwards).

### Slice A — ratio 0 end to end (2026-08-10)

`seam::runner`'s `MixerW::Dsv4` arm emits, per layer:

```text
hc wrap (attn) : rmsnorm(res, ones) -> Linear(hc_attn_fn) -> HyperConnectMix
                 -> HyperConnectPre -> RmsNorm(attn_norm)
attention      : wq_a -> q_a_norm -> wq_b -> QkNorm{weight:None}
                 -> rope the [nope|rope] TAIL -> Copy to f16 q
                 wkv -> attn_kv_a_norm -> rope the tail -> WriteKv (K and V)
                 Attention{ n_kv:1, sinks, SlidingWindow(swa) }
                 -> rope BACKWARD (de-rope) -> per-group Linear(wo_a, w_off)
                 -> Linear(wo_b)
hc post (attn) : HyperConnectPost  res[0] -> res[1]
hc wrap (ffn)  : ... on res[1] -> RmsNorm(ffn_norm)
ffn            : [hash layers only] GatherI32(tok_ids, ffn_gate_tid2eid)
                 MoeFfn{ SqrtSoftplus, swiglu_clamp_exp[il],
                         exp_probs_b XOR expert_ids }
                 + shared expert (swiglu_clamp_shexp[il]), summed
hc post (ffn)  : HyperConnectPost  res[1] -> res[0]
```

then, once, `HyperConnectMix { gates: None }` + `HyperConnectPre` collapse the
streams back into `hidden` for `output_norm`. Four resolved design points:

- **The residual PING-PONGS between two `[batch, hc_mult, n_embd]` buffers.**
  `Op::HyperConnectPost` cannot run in place — every output element reads every
  `src` stream of `residual`. A layer wraps exactly two sublayers, so the parity
  returns to buffer 0 at every layer boundary and the pair is a fixed a→b→a.
- **The widened stream is seeded by REPLICATING the embedding across the
  `hc_mult` streams.** This is the one piece of the emit that is an assumption
  rather than a transcription — see the caveat in `docs/backlog.md` § B-DSV4-HC.
- **The `[nope | rope]` tail is sliced with ONE `Op::CopyStrided` each way**, at
  `rows = batch * n_head`, `src_stride = head_dim`, `src_off = nope` — the
  packed result is then a plain `n_head`-head rope row. Three sites: q, kv, and
  the backward de-rope of the attention output.
- **`Op::Attention` reads an f16 `q`** (the seam's producer→consumer dtype
  flow), so the normed+roped f32 query is `Op::Copy`d into `q16` exactly as
  llama4's NoPE layer casts its unroped one. The rope itself stays on the f32
  buffer.

Two things outside the emit had to move with it:

- **Vulkan's `Op::Linear` now takes `w_off` on an F32 weight**, by shifting the
  weight's `bufferDeviceAddress` base rather than adding a push field — every
  float GEMV here already addresses its weight by pointer, and `w_off` is
  row-aligned, so the slice IS a shifted pointer. F16 stays refused (four more
  call sites, an alignment obligation, and no caller). Without this the grouped
  output projection could not run on Vulkan at all with an f32 `wo_a`.
- **V4 is excluded from the record-once decode replay tape**, exactly as
  `deepseek2` already is. Its four new ops have no dyn twins, so the adapter's
  `decode_eligible` is false and the tape would have been executed STATICALLY
  with `pos = 0` baked into every `WriteKv` and `Attention` — every token
  writing its KV to row 0 and attending only itself. Measured before the fix:
  the CPU-vs-Vulkan cosine fell 1.0 → 0.95 → 0.67 over prompt lengths 1, 2, 3,
  while a `sliding_window = 1` model (where attending only your own row IS
  correct) stayed exact and hid it.

What ratio 0 does NOT cover, and is refused rather than approximated: compressed
layers (ratios 4/128).

### Slice A2 — hash routing end to end (2026-08-13)

A layer below `hash_layer_count` takes its experts from its own
`blk.N.ffn_gate_tid2eid` — an i32 `{n_expert_used, n_vocab}` table indexed by
TOKEN ID — instead of the router's top-k. The op that consumes the selection
(`Op::MoeFfn::expert_ids`) already existed; what was missing was the gather that
produces it, so the layer was refused by name. It now emits:

- **`Op::GatherI32`** — `ggml_get_rows` on an integer table:
  `dst[r, :] = table[ids[r], :]`, values copied, no dequant and no scale. CPU
  interpreter arm plus `gather_i32.comp` on Vulkan; **Metal refuses it by name**
  (its device MoE path already refuses V4's mandatory sqrt-softplus gating, so a
  V4 MoE layer could not run there either way — `docs/backlog.md` §
  B-DSV4-HASH).
- **Not a mode of `Op::EmbedGather`.** That kernel walks the table in whole
  32-element sub-blocks (`nsub = ne / 32`), so a row of `n_expert_used` integers
  (6 on the shipped file) is narrower than one sub-block and gathers nothing —
  since `c5f542a` a hard host-side assert rather than silent zeros. It also
  dequantizes through `native_decode.glsl`, which has no I32 format, and scales
  the result. Three semantics that do not belong on an integer lookup.
- **The table is BOUND as a storage buffer**, not read through the resident-BDA
  arena the way `embed_gather` reads `token_embd`: it is
  `n_expert_used * n_vocab` dwords (3.1 MB on the shipped V4 file), far inside
  `maxStorageBufferRange`, and one addressing mode is cheaper to reason about
  than two.
- **The token-id Input is declared for the gather's sake too.** It used to exist
  only under `gpu_embed` (the on-device embed gather), which gates on a
  `token_embd` dtype the gather kernels cover — a model can fail that and still
  be hash-routed. `build` now declares the ids whenever a hash-routed layer is
  in the span, and `hidden` stays an Input unless the EMBEDDING really is
  gathered on-device. Both binds live in one place (`bind_step_input`) so the
  per-token and record-once paths cannot drift.
- **No host round trip is added.** V4 is excluded from the record-once replay
  tape and from the chained decode, so every V4 step already goes through the
  per-token loop, where the host has just fed `cur[pos]`; the gather's input is
  the same 4-byte id upload that path already does (or, under `gpu_embed`, the
  identical buffer the embed gather reads).
- **The table's shape is validated, not clamped.** `generate_dense_backend`
  refuses a `ffn_gate_tid2eid` that is not `expert_used_count * vocab` entries,
  because the gather indexes it by token id with no bounds clamp — the same
  contract `Op::EmbedGather` reads `token_embd` under.

What the routing weights are is unchanged and was already pinned at the op
level: `build_moe_ffn` takes them from `ggml_get_rows(probs, selected_experts)`,
i.e. the router's own sqrt-softplus probability at each hash-chosen expert, so
the router matmul still runs and only `argsort_top_k` (with `exp_probs_b` and
the group masking that feed only it) is skipped.

Slice 2 added the op-level pieces V4's attention needs, on CPU, Vulkan and
Metal, with op-level parity tests in `crates/infr-llama/tests/seam_op_parity.rs`
and `crates/infr-metal/tests/parity.rs`:

1. **Unweighted per-head RMS norm on Q** — `Op::QkNorm { weight: Option<_> }`.
   `None` is the bare `ggml_rms_norm` V4 calls after `wq_b`; a ones-vector
   weight would be a fake operand costing a real allocation.
2. **Attention sinks** — `Op::Attention { sinks: Option<_> }`, `[n_head]` f32.
   Read off `ggml_compute_forward_soft_max_f32`'s `src2` handling: the sink
   joins the softmax MAX **and** the DENOMINATOR, and never the numerator.
   `None` for every existing arch, so no current model's numerics move.
3. **Rope BACKWARD** — `Op::Rope { backward: bool }`. `ggml_rope_ext_back` is
   the same kernel with `sin_sign = -1`: `cos` untouched, `sin` negated, i.e.
   the TRANSPOSE. That is only the INVERSE when `mscale == 1` — ggml applies
   `attn_factor` to both `cos` and `sin` and `sin_sign` does not undo it, so a
   YaRN'd forward-then-back scales by `mscale²`. V4 sidesteps it exactly:
   `dsv4_rope_attn_factor` returns `1/(1 + 0.1·ln(1/freq_scale))` whenever
   `ext_factor != 0`, cancelling YaRN's correction to `mscale == 1` at every V4
   rope call site. `Op::Rope` carries no magnitude scale at all, so `backward`
   is an exact inverse there.
4. **The grouped low-rank output projection needs NO new op.** `wo_a`'s batch
   axis is the OUTERMOST axis of both operands in `ggml_mul_mat`, so group `g`
   is exactly `Op::Linear` over `wo_a` rows `[g·o_lora_rank, (g+1)·o_lora_rank)`
   — which `Op::Linear::w_off` already selects — over output columns
   `[g·o_group_dim, (g+1)·o_group_dim)`, which `Op::CopyStrided` already slices.
   The Vulkan caveat this listed — `w_off` refused on the f32/f16 fallbacks — is
   half resolved: F32 now rides a shifted device address (see "Slice A"), F16 is
   still refused.

The GPU coverage is deliberately narrow, because each new capability lives in
ONE kernel rather than across the whole tier ladder — see `docs/backlog.md` (§
B-DSV4) for exactly which shapes are refused and what a perf pass would need.

**The LOAD path is complete.** A `deepseek4` GGUF registers, parses into a
`Config` — including the per-layer `compress_ratios` array, the per-layer SwiGLU
clamps and the mandatory sqrt-softplus gating — and loads every tensor, with
each layer's set chosen by its ratio and its hash/bias routing.
`Config::deepseek2` is FALSE for V4 (unlike V3.2, which genuinely is V2 plus an
indexer); every reader of that flag was enumerated and is MLA-specific. A model
with any non-zero ratio is then refused by name, with an `assert!` at the top of
the build closure as the backstop — `wpush`'s Dsv4 arm declares the ratio-0
tensor set only, so a compressed layer reaching the builder would bind every
later weight one buffer off. Hash-routed layers are no longer refused: their
`ffn_gate_tid2eid` occupies the SAME slot of the upload order that a bias-routed
layer's `exp_probs_b` does, and `wpush` pushes exactly one of the two.

A genuinely different architecture, not an increment. Sharing with stage 2 is
limited to the MoE block, the FFN, norms, and generic rope/embedding plumbing.

**V4 is not MLA.** There is no `kv_lora_rank`, no `wk_b`/`wv_b`. Instead:

1. **Single-head MQA KV** — `wkv` is `{n_embd, n_embd_head}`, one KV head for
   all query heads. The Q path keeps its LoRA (`wq_a`/`q_a_norm`/`wq_b`) and
   adds an **unweighted per-head RMS-norm on Q** with no analogue in V2/V3.2.
2. **Low-rank grouped output projection** — `wo_a` + `wo_b` over
   `attention.output_group_count` groups.
3. **Attention sinks** — `attn_sinks {n_head}`.
4. **De-roping of the attention output** — the rope slice of the output is
   rotated _backwards_ by the query position before the output projection
   (`ggml_rope_ext_back`). Nothing else in the family does this.
5. **Hyper-connections** — `hc_mult` parallel residual streams with learned
   Sinkhorn-normalised mixing, replacing `x = x + f(x)` everywhere.
6. **Three-tier per-layer attention** keyed on
   `compress_ratios[il] ∈ {0, 4, 128}`.
7. **Compressor blocks** that softmax-pool blocks of tokens into single KV rows.
8. **Hash-routed MoE** on the first `hash_layer_count` layers. ✓ emitted (see
   "Slice A2").
9. **`sqrt(softplus)` gating**, mandatory (`MoeGating::SqrtSoftplus`, already
   there since stage 2).
10. **Per-layer SwiGLU clamping**, with V4 clamping the gate **pre-SiLU** where
    every other arch clamps post-SiLU. ✓ emitted.

No dense-lead layers, no NextN.

#### ✓ LANDED (2026-08-10 at the op level, 2026-08-13 emitted) — items 8 and 10

**Per-layer SwiGLU clamping** is `swiglu_clamp: Option<f32>` on `Op::GatedAct`,
`Op::GatedActFused` (the dense / shared-expert path, `swiglu_clamp_shexp[il]`)
and `Op::MoeFfn` (the routed experts, `swiglu_clamp_exp[il]`). One arithmetic,
read off `llm_graph_context::build_ffn` and `build_moe_ffn`:

```text
up   = clamp(up, -limit, +limit)      // symmetric
gate = clamp(gate, -INFINITY, limit)  // ONE-SIDED, upper bound only
out  = silu(gate) * up                // the gate clamp is BEFORE the activation
```

- The `limit > 1e-6` disabled gate lives in exactly one place,
  `infr_core::graph::swiglu_clamp(limit)`, which turns a raw per-layer array
  entry into the field. Passing a non-clamping layer's `0.0` straight through as
  `Some(0.0)` would clamp that whole FFN to zero — verified by injection, the
  output goes to all ±0.
- **Where the pre/post orders actually differ is narrower than it looks.** For a
  positive limit the two agree everywhere the gate is negative
  (`silu(g) < 0 < limit`, so the upper bound never bites either way), and the
  whole negative lobe is inert. They separate only where `gate > limit`, by
  `|silu(limit) − limit|` times the clamped `up` — the gap therefore grows with
  the LIMIT, not with how far the gate reaches below zero. `seam_op_parity.rs`'s
  `swiglu_clamp_orders_are_distinguishable` asserts both halves of that.
- Only the gated SiLU/GELU forms carry it (llama.cpp clamps in its
  `LLM_FFN_SILU` arm); a clamped `Activation::Sigmoid`, and a clamp alongside
  llama4's `weight_before` (which would clamp the already-weighted values), are
  refused on every backend rather than silently approximated.

**Hash-routed MoE** is `expert_ids: Option<TensorId>` on `Op::MoeFfn` — the
`[rows, n_expert_used]` I32 selection already gathered from `ffn_gate_tid2eid`
by TOKEN ID, i.e. llama.cpp's `selected_experts_in`. What supplying it changes,
read off `build_moe_ffn`, is **only the selection**:

- The router matmul still runs and the gating function still produces `probs`.
  The routing WEIGHTS stay `ggml_get_rows(probs, selected_experts)` — the
  router's own probability at each hash-chosen expert, then `norm_w` and
  `w_scale` exactly as on a top-k layer. **They are not uniform**; the uniform
  `1/n_used` reading is asserted to differ and shown to fail.
- `ggml_argsort_top_k` is skipped, and with it everything that only feeds
  `selection_probs`: `exp_probs_b` and the group masking. llama.cpp nulls
  `exp_probs_b` on a hash layer for the same reason, so the two are refused
  alongside `expert_ids` instead of being computed and discarded. Every backend
  branches around the selection rather than overwriting it.

**The gather is `Op::GatherI32`** — see "Slice A2 — hash routing end to end"
above for why it is a separate op rather than a mode of `Op::EmbedGather`, and
`docs/backlog.md` § B-DSV4-HASH for what it still does not cover (Metal, the
paged MoE path, perf).

### `compress_ratio` is the master per-layer switch

`hparams.set_swa_pattern(0)` makes **every** layer sliding-window, so long-range
recall comes exclusively from the compressed caches.

| ratio | flavour                 | caches                                                |
| ----: | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
|     0 | pure sliding window     | raw SWA only                                          |
|     4 | CSA + lightning indexer | raw SWA + CSA(4:1) + LID(4:1) + two compressor states |
|   128 | HCA                     | raw SWA + HCA(128:1) + compressor state               |

The two ratio-4 compressor states are **overlapping** (`state_size == 2*ratio`,
so each committed row pools a 2×ratio window); the ratio-128 one is **not**
(`state_size == ratio`). That asymmetry is in the constructor, not in the graph
— see "The compressed-KV state machine" below.

Only `{0, 4, 128}` are accepted. Compressed layers use YaRN at
`compress_rope_theta`; ratio-0 layers use plain unscaled rope. `kq_scale` is
plain `1/sqrt(n_embd_head)` at all three call sites — none of stage 2's mscale²
games.

V4's indexer differs from V3.2's in three structural ways. **There is no
`indexer_attn_k` and no `indexer_k_norm`** — the indexer keys come from the
compressor, so `index_topk` counts _compressed blocks_, not tokens. And its rope
is **NORM** with a **`[nope | rope]`** head, both the opposite of V3.2: see "Two
corrections to what this document said about V4's indexer" below, which reads
them off the source.

### Sinkhorn hyper-connections

The residual stream is widened to `hc_mult` copies. Each sublayer is wrapped
`pre → sublayer → post`, where one matmul produces three chunks — `pre` (stream
collapse weights), `post` (per-stream output gates) and `comb` (an `hc × hc`
mixing matrix). `comb` is made approximately doubly-stochastic by Sinkhorn
iteration, so no stream's mass blows up or vanishes with depth.

```
comb = softmax(comb) + eps          # softmax over dst
norm_cols()                          # then n_iter column normalisations
for i in 1..n_iter: norm_rows(); norm_cols()
```

Then `out[i, dst] = x[i]·post[dst] + Σ_src residual[i, src]·comb[dst, src]`.

**Expect to get this wrong twice.** The index formula is
`logits[dst, src, t] = mixes[2·hc + dst + hc·src, t]·scale + base[...]`; the
loop is asymmetric (`n_iter` column normalisations, `n_iter − 1` row); eps is
added in three distinct places; and llama.cpp's own lambda names
`norm_rows`/`norm_cols` are **inverted** relative to its header's `dst`/`src`
vocabulary. Trust the index formula and the lambda bodies, not the names.

#### ✓ LANDED at the op level (2026-08-10) — nothing emits them yet

Three ops on CPU + Vulkan + Metal, mirroring llama.cpp's three fused nodes:
`Op::HyperConnectMix` (`ggml_dsv4_hc_comb` plus the `pre`/`post` gate arithmetic
the reference leaves as elementwise views), `Op::HyperConnectPre`
(`ggml_dsv4_hc_pre`) and `Op::HyperConnectPost` (`ggml_dsv4_hc_post`).
`build_hc_head` is NOT a fourth op: its `output_hc_fn` is `{hc_dim, hc}` so its
`mixes` is exactly the `pre` chunk, read at the same `scale[0]` / `base[0..hc]`
indices — it is `Op::HyperConnectMix { gates: None }`. `hc_mult` is accepted in
`1..=HYPER_CONNECT_MAX_MULT` (8) and refused on the host beyond that, because
every backend holds a token's whole `hc × hc` matrix in a fixed-size array.

Resolving the warnings above, verified in `seam_op_parity.rs`'s
`hyper_connect_*` against a from-definition f64 reference (each of the nine
deviations below was injected into the CPU arm and shown to go red):

- **`norm_cols` reduces over `src`; `norm_rows` reduces over `dst`.**
  llama.cpp's `norm_cols` permutes so `src` is `ne[0]` before `ggml_sum_rows`;
  its `norm_rows` sums the matrix as laid out, whose `ne[0]` is `dst`. Both
  names are the opposite of the axis they touch. The loop therefore ends on an
  over-`src` normalisation, which is why `Σ_src comb[dst, ·] = 1` comes out
  exact to eps level while `Σ_dst` is only as converged as the iteration got.
- **The doubly-stochastic property does NOT catch a transposed `comb` index.**
  Sinkhorn of a transposed matrix is Sinkhorn of another matrix: it still ends
  on `norm_src` and its sums are just as well behaved. What the sums DO catch is
  giving the extra normalisation to `dst` (i.e. trusting the lambda names). The
  transposed index is caught by value — it moves the output by ~1.
- **Sinkhorn does not converge on peaked logits.** At `hc = 4, n_iter = 3` with
  logits spread over ±8, `|Σ_dst − 1| ≈ 0.5`. That is the algorithm (its rate
  collapses as the matrix approaches a permutation), not a port bug; asserting
  convergence needs mild logits and tens of iterations.
- **The asymmetric COUNT is nearly inert, for a reason worth knowing.** The
  softmax already leaves every `src` column summing to `1 + hc·eps`, so the
  symmetric variant's extra leading `norm_dst` is a UNIFORM rescale that the
  following `norm_src` undoes. What survives is second order in eps: ~1e-11 at
  `eps = 1e-6`, ~9e-5 at `eps = 1e-2`. The count is pinned, but only the
  large-eps case pins it for an f32 backend.
- **At `hc = 1` almost every Sinkhorn detail is genuinely inert** (a 1×1 matrix
  is its own transpose, `norm_src` and `norm_dst` are the same operation, and
  the iteration's fixed point does not depend on the initial value). It is a
  kernel SHAPE case, not a semantics one.

### The compressed-KV state machine

This is the **largest single porting risk in the family**, and it is now
specified rather than guessed: `llama-kv-cache-dsv4.cpp` (1978 lines) has been
read in full, together with its header, `deepseek4.cpp`'s consumers and
`llama-graph.cpp`'s input setters. Everything below is read off those files;
where an earlier revision of this document disagreed, the file won and the
paragraph was rewritten.

#### The inventory, exactly

Not "seven cache structures" — the constructor
(`llama-kv-cache-dsv4.cpp:1013-1131`) builds **five caches and three compressor
states**, and only four of the caches are reachable from a V4 graph:

| structure   | kind                | rows                            | row width             |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `kv_raw`    | ISWA base half      | —                               | never read by V4      |
| `kv_raw`    | ISWA **SWA** half   | the sliding window              | `n_embd_head_k`       |
| `kv_csa`    | K-only block cache  | `PAD(ceil(kv_size/4), 256)`     | `n_embd_head_k`       |
| `kv_hca`    | K-only block cache  | `PAD(ceil(kv_size/128), 256)`   | `n_embd_head_k`       |
| `kv_lid`    | K-only block cache  | `PAD(ceil(kv_size/4), 256)`     | `indexer_head_size`   |
| `csa_state` | compressor state ×2 | `state_size = 2*4 = 8`          | `2*n_embd_head_k`     |
| `hca_state` | compressor state ×2 | `state_size = 128` (**not** 2×) | `n_embd_head_k`       |
| `lid_state` | compressor state ×2 | `state_size = 2*4 = 8`          | `2*indexer_head_size` |

"×2" is literal: each compressor state is **two** f32 tensors, `kv` and `score`,
both `[n_embd_state, state_size, n_stream]` and both always f32 regardless of
`type_k`. The raw base half is allocated for generic ISWA bookkeeping and the
header says so outright: "DSV4 raw attention only uses the SWA half of
`kv_raw`."

Two consequences the old prose hid. **`state_size == 2*ratio` is what makes a
compressor overlapping, and only CSA and LID are** — `hca_state` gets
`state_size == ratio`, so HCA pools a single non-overlapping block. And **the
LID plan is not computed at all**: `plans_lid(plans_csa)` (line 1785) copies the
CSA plan verbatim, because both run at ratio 4 with `overlap = true` and the
same `state_size`. Only the row widths differ.

#### The per-ubatch plan

`dsv4_build_comp_plan` (lines 418-599) is the whole state machine. Per token, at
absolute position `pos`:

```text
state_pos[i]  = pos % ratio                 // APE row id, gathers attn_comp_ape
n_visible[i]  = (pos + 1) / ratio           // FLOOR — completed blocks only
plan.n_kv     = GGML_PAD(max_i n_visible[i], 256)
```

The compressor state is a **ring of `state_size` rows** indexed
`pos % state_size`, and `state_persist_{src,dst}_idxs` carry one entry per
distinct ring row the ubatch touches, keeping the highest `pos` when several
tokens collide (lines 496-505) and sorted by destination (line 576) so the write
order is deterministic.

A compressed row is committed **only on a block boundary**,
`(pos + 1) % ratio == 0` (line 507), to cache row `pos / ratio`, with
`state_write_pos = pos + 1 - ratio` — the block's FIRST position, which is what
the compressed row then ropes at.

`state_source_idx` (lines 461-476) is the join that makes this work. It
addresses a graph-local tensor laid out
`[persistent_state | current_ubatch_scratch | sentinel]`:

- `pos < 0` → `state_rows + n_tokens`, the appended zero/`-inf` sentinel row;
- `pos` present in this ubatch → `state_rows + i`, the scratch row;
- otherwise → `stream_off + pos % state_size`, the persistent ring row.

For the overlapping compressors the reads are collected into **two contiguous
halves** — every block's previous-window indices, then every block's
current-window indices (lines 565-572) — which is exactly how
`build_overlap_compressed_kv_from_state` slices them back apart
(`deepseek4.cpp:463-489`). Getting that concatenation order wrong swaps the two
halves of every pooling window and still runs.

The pooling itself (the same four lines in
`build_overlap_compressed_kv_from_state` and in the HCA variant) is
**per-channel softmax over the WINDOW axis** — the `ratio` (or `2*ratio`) cached
rows a block pools — not over the feature axis: values and scores are both
permuted so the window index becomes the fast axis, `soft_max` runs, and
`sum_rows` collapses it. Then RMS-norm by `attn_comp_norm`, rope the
`[nope | rope]` tail at `compress_rope_base`, and write.

#### ✓ LANDED at the op level (2026-08-13) — nothing emits it yet

`Op::CompressPool` on CPU + Vulkan + Metal, one op for the four ggml nodes both
compressor variants share once their gathers have diverged (the pair of
`ggml_permute`+`ggml_cont`s, the `soft_max`, the `mul` and the `sum_rows`).
`values`/`scores` arrive `[blocks, window, n_embd]` and the permutes are folded
into the op's indexing, so infr pays none of the reference's two `ggml_cont`s of
the full permuted tensor. `window` is the op's name for what is `DSV4_HCA_RATIO`
on an HCA layer and `2*ratio` on the overlapping CSA/LID one, which is why one
op serves both.

Verified in `seam_op_parity.rs`'s `compress_pool_*` against a from-definition
f64 reference over windows 4 / 8 / 128, `blocks` 1 and >1, and an `n_embd` that
is not a multiple of a workgroup. Four deviations were injected into the CPU arm
and shown to go red; two are worth carrying forward:

- **Softmaxing the feature axis runs and looks fine.** It stays finite, keeps
  the output shape and lands in the right order of magnitude — it moved the
  answer by ~14× the output scale, but nothing downstream would have said so.
  This is the whole reason the pooling is one op rather than four generic ones.
- **The `-inf` sentinel does NOT by itself expose a missing max-subtract.**
  `exp(-inf)` is exactly `0.0`, so the naive `exp(s)/Σexp(s)` is algebraically
  the same answer on a window with SOME sentinel lanes. It breaks in exactly two
  places, and both are now test cases: scores large enough for `exp` to overflow
  f32, and a window that is ENTIRELY `-inf`.

That last case is `0/0`. **infr writes `0.0`; ggml produces `NaN`** — its
`ggml_vec_soft_max_f32` computes `exp(-inf − -inf)` and scales by `1/NaN`,
caught only by an `assert(sum > 0.0)` that release builds compile out. The
deviation is deliberate: zero is the value the sentinel's own zero `values` make
meaningful, a NaN cannot be told from a real defect once it has spread, and
three backends can be tested to agree on `0.0` where `NaN != NaN` makes a parity
assertion vacuous.

#### The four boundary conditions

Each is a place where a plausible implementation runs and is wrong.

1. **A partial block at the end of a prefill is invisible, and is never
   committed.** `n_visible` floors, and the commit is gated on
   `(pos + 1) % ratio == 0`. Tokens in a trailing partial block are recalled
   through the raw sliding window alone; their compressor-state rows persist and
   the block completes on a later ubatch. An implementation that ceils
   `n_visible`, or that flushes the partial block at the end of a prefill,
   exposes a row built from a half-filled window.

2. **`n_kv == 0` changes the GRAPH, not just the mask.**
   `dsv4_build_comp_inputs` builds `inp.kq_mask` only `if (plan.n_kv > 0)`
   (`llama-graph.cpp:839`), and `build_attention` dispatches on that mask being
   non-null (`deepseek4.cpp:1050-1063`). So a ubatch in which **no** token has
   completed a block — any prefill shorter than 128 tokens on an HCA layer,
   shorter than 4 on a CSA layer — runs `build_raw_attention` instead: pure
   sliding window, no compressed half at all. This is the first thing a short
   synthetic prefill will hit, and it is a different graph, so it cannot be
   papered over with masking.

3. **Padded `n_kv` versus per-token visible length.** `plan.n_kv` is padded to
   256 so the graph shape does not change at every block boundary, and the mask
   is a plain per-token prefix:
   `data[i*ne0 + j] = j < n_visible[i] ? 0 : -INFINITY`
   (`llama-graph.cpp:659-681`). Rows in `[n_visible[i], n_kv)` therefore cover
   committed-but-not-yet-visible data and never-written zeros alike, and both
   are masked identically. A token whose `n_visible` is 0 while others in the
   ubatch are larger gets an **all-`-inf` compressed half** and must survive on
   the raw half plus the attention sink — which is exactly why the sink joins
   the softmax max as well as the denominator.

4. **The CSA scratch write.** On a non-boundary CSA step, lines 534-563 push a
   dummy commit to `cache_off + kv_size - 1` — the cache's LAST row — sourced
   from one repeated row, purely so a decode step's graph matches a boundary
   step's. It is garbage, and it is safe only because `n_visible < kv_size`
   always keeps it masked. **HCA has no such fallback** (the branch is gated
   `ratio == DSV4_CSA_RATIO`), so an HCA layer's commit op genuinely appears and
   disappears with the block boundary.

#### Two corrections to what this document said about V4's indexer

Both are contradicted by the source, and both would produce silent wrongness.

- **V4's indexer ropes NORM, not NEOX.** Stage 3 above makes much of V3.2's
  indexer being NEOX-hardcoded while the main rope is NORM. V4 does **not**
  inherit that: `build_lid_top_k` ropes `indexer_q_pe` with the graph's
  `rope_type` (`deepseek4.cpp:555-557`), and `llama_model::rope_type` puts
  `LLM_ARCH_DEEPSEEK4` in the NORM group (`llama-model.cpp:2530`). Every V4 rope
  call site — q, kv, both compressors, the indexer — is NORM. The
  `hparams_lid.rope_type = LLAMA_ROPE_TYPE_NEOX` at
  `llama-kv-cache-dsv4.cpp:1063` is dead: it feeds only the KV-shift path, and
  `llama_kv_cache_dsv4::get_can_shift()` returns `false`.
- **V4's indexer head layout is `[nope | rope]`** — the opposite of V3.2's, and
  the same order as V4's own q and kv heads. `indexer_q_nope` is the view at
  offset 0, `indexer_q_pe` the view at `row_size(nope)`, concatenated in that
  order (`deepseek4.cpp:546-560`).

#### What the Hadamard rotation actually gates

`attn_rot_k` is normally on only for a quantized KV cache, but
`llama-kv-cache.cpp:346-356` force-enables it when the arch is DEEPSEEK32,
DEEPSEEK4 or GLM_DSA **and** `n_embd_head_k_full == indexer_head_size` — which
is true for the LID cache by construction (`hparams_lid` sets both, lines
1059-1062) and generally false for raw/CSA/HCA. That matters because
`build_attention`'s CSA dispatch is guarded on `inp_dsv4->get_lid().k_rot` being
non-null (`deepseek4.cpp:1053`): the guard passes for the reason above, but it
is keyed on a quantisation artifact rather than on anything semantic. The
rotation itself is orthogonal and applied to both sides of every dot product, so
an unquantised port skips it entirely — as stage 3 already does.

Budget stage 4 accordingly, and do not start it until stages 2–3 are solid.

## Open questions — check these before trusting the above

Ordered by how much damage a wrong assumption does.

1. **Head layouts and exact dims** — everything here about
   `192 / 576 / 512 / 64 / 128` came from conversion-script formulas, not from a
   GGUF. Dump a real file.
2. **ggml type ids in V4 GGUFs** — if any weight type falls outside
   `ggml_type_to_dtype`, the file fails at open and needs a new `DType`,
   `block_spec` and `dequant_block` arm. The i2_s commit `dbc8431` is the
   template.
3. **Whether N successive splits reproduce llama.cpp's tokenizer** (§0.2) — ✓
   RESOLVED (2026-08-09), for `deepseek-llm` only. `infr`'s ids were compared
   against `llama-tokenize --ids --no-bos --no-escape` on
   `deepseek-v2-lite-chat-q4_k_m.gguf`. Note that this GGUF is
   `tokenizer.ggml.pre == "deepseek-llm"`, **not** `deepseek-v3` — so what it
   exercises is the six-regex V1 list, the one that carried both transcription
   slips. They agreed **exactly on all 31 texts**, covering digits, decimals and
   grouped numbers, CJK, Hangul, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, punctuation
   runs, code, emoji, CRLF, smart quotes and non-ASCII whitespace. So N
   successive `Isolated` splits do reproduce `unicode_regex_split` here.

   The comparison was shown to be capable of failing: re-introducing the U+0027
   slip made `infr` disagree with llama.cpp on 8 of 11 texts in the
   NBSP-before-punctuation battery (e.g. `"a \u{00A0}. b"` → llama.cpp
   `[64, 207, 1202, 13, 270]`, broken `infr` `[64, 30683, 13, 270]`).

   **`deepseek-coder` and `deepseek-v3` have no token-id coverage.** Both GGUFs
   in the local HF cache are `deepseek-llm`, so neither of those lists was
   exercised against real ids. They are structurally identical (same
   `build_multi_split_seq`) and byte-identical to the reference, and their chunk
   boundaries are pinned by the unit test — but that is not the same as having
   been checked against llama.cpp. Re-open this for either list if a matching
   GGUF appears.

4. **Shared-expert width when `n_shared_experts > 1`** — V2-Lite has 2.
5. **`rope_off`** — ✓ RESOLVED (2026-08-06). `Op::Rope` only rotates standalone
   k_pe slices (extracted via `CopyStrided`, no nope prefix). The q_pe rope is
   done inside the MLA kernel at offset `qk_nope_dim` — the offset lives in the
   kernel, not in `Op::Rope`. No `rope_off` field needed.
6. **YaRN** — RESOLVED (2026-08-07). The per-dimension frequency ramp IS
   implemented and the mscale² is a constant (both folded per `ggml_rope_yarn` +
   `deepseek2.cpp:162-172`). The earlier note claimed the ramp is "INERT for
   default deepseek2 GGUFs" because it assumed the convert script never writes
   `rope.scaling.factor`/`type` — **wrong**: the V2-Lite Q4_K GGUF declares
   `rope.scaling.type = yarn`, `factor = 40`, `original_context_length = 4096`,
   `yarn_log_multiplier = 0.0707`, which makes llama.cpp set
   `yarn_ext_factor = 1.0` (llama-context.cpp:189-191) and run the FULL ramp at
   every context length. Without it, infr's greedy output was
   `"Reply Collabor…"` garbage while llama.cpp produced coherent text. The ramp
   lives in `Op::Rope.freq_factors` (per-pair divisors, computed in the seam
   from the corr_dims spectral ramp) plus the MLA kernels' internal q_pe rope;
   the mscale² is folded into the MLA attention scale as a constant
   (`mscale = 1 + 0.1·log_mul·ln(factor)`, applied via
   `mla_scale = mscale²/√(qk_nope + qk_rope)` — note `qk_nope = head_k_mla` is
   128 for V2-Lite, so the denominator is √192, not √576). The rope vector
   mscale cancels to `rope_attn_factor` for deepseek2, so no vector scaling is
   needed in the kernels.
7. **DeepSeek's EOS** — `add_chat_eos` appends a fixed list that does not
   include `<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`. It is normally the GGUF's declared
   `tokenizer.ggml.eos_token_id` and therefore already in `eos_ids`, but check
   whether the chat template ends turns on something else.
8. **`LLM_TENSOR_ATTN_KV_NORM` and `LLM_TENSOR_ATTN_KV_A_NORM` share the on-disk
   name** `blk.%d.attn_kv_a_norm`. Two enum values, one string — not
   distinguishable on disk.
9. **llama.cpp's V4 support is young.** Its model-type detection for V4 is a
   stub where both branches return `UNKNOWN`. Treat the reference as possibly
   buggy rather than authoritative.

## What was not covered

- `deepseek2-ocr` — out of scope.
- The **DSpark speculative module** (`dspark_block_size`,
  `dspark_target_layer_ids`, `dspark_markov_rank`). It is a separate head over
  V4's last three layers and does not appear in the graph builder at all. `infr`
  has MTP machinery (`docs/mtp.md`) that may host it; not investigated.
- V3.2's **NextN** tensors — loaded but skipped by llama.cpp.
- Performance. This plan is about correctness only. Nothing here is measured,
  and no throughput claim is made.
